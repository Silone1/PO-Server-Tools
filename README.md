## TheUnknownOne's Server Tools

### Server Script (scripts.js)
<b>Version:</b> 3.0.0 Devel | **[Report bugs](issues/)**

Currently in development. It's not recommended to use these in production (or at all, really).

Modules are in the 'scripts' directory.

Licensed under [MIT](LICENSE.txt). Contains T-Lite (https://raw.github.com/CapMousse/T-Lite/master/tlite.js) which uses the BSD license.

### safeSys (extras/safeSys.js)

This is a little script that ensures sys (and its methods) exists. Useful if you're testing your script in a browser/CommonJS.

It does **NOT** ensure that SESSION exists. That might be implemented later.

Public domain.

### Batch files (batch/*)

Some simple batch files (needs **Windows**) that, say, run the po server headless.

Place these in your server directory to use them.
