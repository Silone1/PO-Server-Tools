Experiment: tempBan behavior

To ban: sys.tempBan(name, time_in_minutes);
To find ban time: sys.dbTempBanTime(name) => time_in_seconds
To unban: sys.unban(name);

beforePlayerBan(..., ..., time) is a time in minutes.

sys.dbTempBanTime(name) is very unreliable. Only use it if you're sure they're banned (check with sys.banList).

It returns the time in seconds, but only if the player has been banned. Otherwise it returns large numbers such as 4294967206.

tempBan should not use floating point numbers. This can cause weird behavior as well. So, no second bans.

time (in beforePlayerBan) is undefined if the ban isn't a tempBan.
