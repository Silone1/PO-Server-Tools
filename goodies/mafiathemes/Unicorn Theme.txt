    "summary": "Unicorn returns! The teams are White Unicorns (village), Black & Grey Unicorns (the mafias), Flying Unicorn (godfather-ish), Rainbow Unicorn (conspirator), and the Humans (Unicorn Hunter and Mad Scientist(s)). The PRs are: Intelligent (small: inspect; medium: inspect + reveal; big: inspect + daykill), Wizard (small: protect; medium-big: protect + safeguard; 0.5% chance to die when /protect is used), Crying (small: distract; medium: distract + stalk; big: distract x2 + stalk), King (small: hax on all; medium-big: hax on all, +2 vote, kill). The Black and Grey Unicorns have an intelligent unicorn and a king of their own too! The Flying Unicorn has two kills, and a daykill with chance to be revealed, and the Rainbow Unicorn wins with anyone and can convert someone (can't convert any intelligent unicorns for obvious reasons) to a pretty much useless version of what they once were. The Unicorn Hunter is alone in small-medium games (1 kill), but will eventually get backup from mad scientists who mutate unicorns (outspeeds anything the Sad White Unicorn and the White Unicorn Wizard) causing them to die in 2 nights and revenge killers with a poison effect (that takes only 2 nights). That should be about it! Have fun! ~ TheUnknownOne [Take a look at /roles!]",
